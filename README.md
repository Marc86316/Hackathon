# Hackathon Preparation Plan: Building an Immersive AI Idol Fan Interaction System

This project aims to leverage AI technologies to create an immersive fan interaction application that embodies the unique "soul" of an idol. The system will integrate image, voice, and text data, utilizing techniques such as natural language processing (NLP), speech conversion, and deep learning to simulate the idol's linguistic style (e.g., catchphrases, tone, and habitual expressions), thereby deepening fans' emotional connection.
